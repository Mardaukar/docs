summary: "Seravo.com heavily utilizes Nginx in both our WordPress environment and routing layer. Here's a short description of our Nginx use"
---

## Background

Traditionally, most hosting sites have been using Apache bundled with PHP as their web server of choice. However, during the last few years many have migrated from Apache to [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/) due to performance benefits and increased flexibility.

## Default settings

Nginx comes pre-configured to use with WordPress in the Seravo setup. There is no need to peruse any guides online on how to set up Nginx with WordPress.

Our default Nginx configuration includes:

* Strong HTTPS settings ([see example](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=seravo.com&s=185.26.50.22))
* A Let's Encrypt certificate for your public domains
* HTTP cache with [stale cache](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_use_stale) configured
* Automatic expiration headers for static content
* The [Pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/) module
* User configurable API
* Gzip
* And lots more...


## Configuration

In most generic Apache hosting platforms, you have the ability to use **.htaccess** files to add custom rules to your web server. There are multiple reasons why this is not optimal, one being the inherently slower execution time for all page loads on the site.

Instead, we give our users access to their nginx configuration through a directory that contains the **.conf** filesm which will be read by Nginx on startup. These configuration files can be found in `/data/wordpress/nginx/*.conf`.

> **Note:** Under the hood, your custom Nginx configuration is included like this:
>
> ```
> server {
>   listen 80 default_server;
>   server_name your-site.com;
>   ...
>
>   include /data/wordpress/nginx/*.conf;
>
>   ...
> }
> ```

## How to create your own rules

The file `/data/wordpress/nginx/examples.conf` includes a few examples for you to start with, all disabled by comments. We recommend that you do not edit this file directly. Leave it as a reference instead and create your own custom.conf file from scratch.

```
$ cd /data/wordpress/nginx
$ nano custom.conf
```

To get started with your configuration you can copy stuff from examples.conf. Remove the comments from the beginning of the line and edit the rules to match the specific needs of your site.

### Restarting Nginx

After you've made changes to your nginx configuration, please reload the configuration by running

```
wp-restart-nginx
```

If there should be any errors `wp-restart-nginx` will warn you about them and refuse to restart before the issue is fixed.

## Examples

### Forcing HTTPS

To force all your users to connect via https, you may redirect them to the https side with a Nginx configuration.

> **Note!** There are many built-in methods in WordPress to enforce HTTPS and the Seravo Plugin also enforces both https and a canonical domain when it can detect that what that those are available, so **most of the time one should not use the Nginx configuration below**.

The preferred method in Nginx to force HTTPS is with a custom variable.

```
# Force redirect http -> https
set $force_https 1;
```

### Making exceptions to the default X-Frame-Options rule

Due to security reasons, [X-Frame-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) is set for all customers of Seravo by default. Customers can set their own X-Frame-Options and thus override the default values, but it cannot be removed altogether.

This can as easily be emitted from PHP code as well with a simple `header("X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL");`. To have this emitted for a section of the WordPress site, the functions.php could include something like this, for example:

```
if ( strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], '/widget/') !== false ) {
  header("X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL");
}
```

If a single page or a section of the site without PHP functionality needs to have a more relaxed rule to allow arbitrary access, it can be done with a rule like this:

```
location /widget/ {
  add_header X-Frame-Options ALLOWALL;
}
```

Note that [ALLOWALL is not an official keyword](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034), but most browsers support it anyway. In the future the whole X-Frame-Options header will be superseded by a new system called [frame ancestors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#directive-frame-ancestors). If a site emits any frame-ancestors headers, the browser will follow those rules and ignore whatever was set in the X-Frame-Options headers.

### Redirects

> **Note!** In most cases [redirects are better done in WordPress/PHP](https://help.seravo.com/en/knowledgebase/13/docs/33-how-do-i-add-custom-configurations-to-the-web-server) e.g. the [Redirection plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/), using the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Rewrite_API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Rewrite_API) or with custom code in e.g. theme functions.php. Use Nginx redirects only if there is no WordPress way to do it, for example when diverting traffic from the index.php to another custom PHP script on the same site.

#### Basic redirects in WordPress/PHP

In PHP code you can express whatever redirection logic you want without being condined to the limited features on Nginx. For example there could be a file `mu-plugins/redirects.php` that would include:

```php
// Redirect any requests for www.esimerkki.fi or esimerkki.fi to example.com/fi/
if ( isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) && strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], 'esimerkki.fi') !== false ) {
  header("Location: https://example.com/fi/", true, 301);
  die();
}
```

Another more elaborate one example would be:
```php
switch ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) {

  # Enforce no www
  # Use 301 to make redirect permanent and cached
  # Use 302 for temporary (non-cached) redirects
  case "www.example.com":
    header("Location: https://example.com/", true, 301);
    break;

  # Multiple extra domains to same canonical domain
  # Note! Many plugins already do this automatically, e.g. Seravo Plugin or Polylang
  case "example.org":
  case "exmple.net":
  case "example.info":
    header("Location: https://example.com/", true, 301);
    break;

  # Localized domain to subfolder
  case "example.fi":
    header("Location: https://example.com/fi/", true, 301);
    break;

  # Localized domain to subfolder
  case "example.de":
    header("Location: https://example.com/de/", true, 301);
    break;

  default:
    header("Location: https://www.happy-or-not.com/en/", true, 301);

}
```

#### Basic redirects in Nginx

Redirects from http://your-site.com/original -> https://example.com/new/url/

```
rewrite ^/original(.*)$ https://example.com/new/url$1 permanent;
```

Rewrite all old \*.html files to WordPress pages with pretty URLs:

```
rewrite ^/([0-9a-z-]+)\.html /$1/ permanent;
```

Serve country pages (example.es, example.de etc) from custom PHP file
```
if ($host ~ "example.es|example.de") {
  rewrite ^(/)?$ /country-pages/index.php last;
}
```

Please use something like [Rexexpal](http://www.regexpal.com/) to test your regular expressions and be sure to use `curl -IL` to test your redirects without having to hassle with the cache of a regular browser.

#### Redirecting domains in Nginx

If you have multiple domains for your site and want to only use one of them:

```
if ($host ~ "old-subdomain.your-old-site.com") {
  return 301 https://your-site.com$request_uri;
}
```

## Testing redirects

Please use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) to test redirects. Using a browser for testing will not work as the browser in most cases will cache the first redirect and after that no changes will be visible when testing with a broser. Using `curl` ensures there is no caching at all and it will print `location:` headers that show clearly what the redirect is.

Example:
```sh
$ curl -IL example.org
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Cache: HIT
Location: https://example.com/
Content-Length: 100

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Cache: HIT
Content-Length: 1270
```

### Serve two different sites from the same domain

Sometimes it makes sense to have two separate sites served from the same domain, as it will contribute to a better user experience and improve the search engine ranking for the content of the sites, when compared to having the site split to separate domains or subdomains. For example, the majority of the site example.com could be hosted on WordPress, but the section example.com/store might be on Magento.

This can be achieved using Nginx proxying. For example, create a file called `/data/wordpress/nginx/store-proxy.conf` with the contents:

```
location /store/ {
  proxy_ssl_server_name on;
  proxy_ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
  proxy_pass https://store.example.com/;
}
```

### Protected/authenticated downloads

The path `/wp-content/uploads/woocommerce_uploads/` is pre-configured by Seravo to be protected and accessible only when authentication is done in WooCommerce/WordPress/PHP while the download itself is handled by Nginx via the X-Sendfile header instructions.

One may place any file in that path and it the server will not allow a direct download of it. It can be accessed only if the PHP code emits a special `X-Accel-Redirect` header with the path of a file in that location.

This is the correct way to implement such a feature, since the PHP worker will not be reserved for the entire download but can continue to serve other PHP requests while the download itself has been offloaded to Nginx to handle.

To make a similar protected folder in a custom location, add the following to e.g. `/data/wordpress/nginx/protected-downloads.conf`:

```nginx
location /protected-files {
  internal;
  alias /data/wordpress/protected-files/;
}
```

In PHP emit the headers as follows:

```php
// Do authentication etc first
if ( current_user_can( 'download_special_files' ) ) {
  // Emit header to Nginx which will send the file to requester
  header('X-Accel-Redirect: //protected-files/confidential.pdf');
} else {
  echo 'Access denied.';
  die();
}
```

### Automatically expiring secure download links

> **Note:** Do not use the secure link feature with WooCommerce. Use the built-in digital download features of WooCommerce instead, which works out-of-the-box at Seravo.

The Nginx Secure Link module can be used to create links to downloadable items (for example a PDF file) that are valid only for a short time.

Example Nginx configuration, e.g. `/data/wordpress/nginx/securelink.conf`:

```nginx
# Make folder inaccessible publicly
location /my-restricted-files/ {
  internal;
  alias /data/wordpress/my-restricted-files/;
}

# Define secure link
location ~ /my-restricted-files/(.*) {
    # Define values used in generating secure links
    secure_link $arg_md5, $arg_expires;

    # Define link form. Replace ASDF1234 with an unique secret
    secure_link_md5 "$secure_link_expires$uri ASDF1234";
    if ($secure_link = "") {
        return 403;
    }
    if ($secure_link = "0") {
        return 410;
    }
}
```

To generate links in PHP use something like:
```php
function securelink($path) {
  $secret = 'ASDF1234'; // the same secret as in Nginx config
  $expires = time() + 86400; // 24h in seconds
  $url = md5sum("$expires/my-restricted-files/example.pdf $SECRET")
}
```

### The PageSpeed module

PageSpeed sniffs through your html documents and rewrites them to be faster. This process is very site specific, so make sure that you test everything carefully before enabling PageSpeed in production. You can find more about all the filters available in [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filters).

#### Turn pagespeed on
```
pagespeed on;
```

#### Add some PageSpeed filters
```
# This does a lot so test which of these you really need
pagespeed EnableFilters rewrite_css,sprite_images,combine_css,inline_css,flatten_css_imports,inline_javascript,combine_javascript,inline_google_font_css,canonicalize_javascript_libraries,rewrite_images,recompress_images;
```

Note that with the introduction of HTTP/2, many of the techniques used by PageSpeed have become obsolete. Currently very few of our customers use PageSpeed because of the limited benefits it brings.
